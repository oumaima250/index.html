                Sure, there were probably other options, but he didn't let them enter his mind.

            <p>The time had come for Nancy to say goodbye. She had been dreading this moment for a good six months, 
                and it had finally arrived despite her best efforts to forestall it. No matter how hard she tried, 
                she couldn't keep the inevitable from happening. 
                So the time had come for a normal person to say goodbye and move on.
               It was at this moment that Nancy decided not to be a normal person. 
             After all the time and effort she had expended,  she couldn't bring herself to do it.</p>

            <h2>resume</h2>
            <p>The irony of the situation hadn't escaped her. 
         She had taken years to sculpt the perfect persona with the perfect look that she shared on Instagram.
        She knew her hundreds of thousands of followers envied that life she showed and stayed engaged with her because they wanted that life too.
        The truth was that she wanted the perfect life she portrayed more than any of her fans.
         The fact was that despite all the perfection she shared on social media,
      her life was actually more of a mess than most.</p>
